          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            For our final project, we present a more robust path tracing technique that can render highly specular scenes with specular and glossy light transport. 
            This technique, vertex connection and merging (VCM), was implemented into our code from project 3 (parts 1 and 2) and can be extended into two parts - 
            photon mapping and bidirectional path tracing. With this implementation, we were able to render more unique lighting effects, specifically caustics and 
            other effects from different media, as well as reduce the amount of noise in our images. 
          </p>

          <!-- Technical Approach -->
          <h3>Technical Approach</h3>

          <h5>Photon Mapping</h5>

          <h5>Bidirectional Path Tracing</h5>

          <h5>Problems Encountered</h5>
          <p>
            During our implementation of the project, we ran into multiple problems, the first involving our compilation of project 3. Because we needed to be able to 
            render glass and mirror materials, but also modify the path tracing technique, we needed a working p3-1 and p3-2. We found that our implementation of p3-1 was 
            entirely working and had to ask for staff support on this, in which we were then able to fix our project and get the “starter” code working. After, when 
            implementing photon mapping, we ran into multiple issues regarding rendering. There were times where our lighting didn’t show the way we wanted to or it 
            didn’t end up showing at all. This required a lot of debugging sessions and also attendance in some office hours to figure out the issue (part of the issue, 
            that we learned, was that we had to modify the skeleton code slightly more than we had originally thought in order to get the lighting working). The other 
            difficulty we had was bidirectional path tracing, mainly because it was more complex conceptually than initially thought, so there was more time spent on 
            researching an implementation and figuring out how to integrate it into our code. To get a better grasp on bidirectional path tracing, we spent more 
            significant time on trying to understand the technique and then working on an implementation. 
          </p>

          <h5>Lessons Learned</h5>
          <p>
            In retrospect, while this project was very engaging, it had its difficulties - trying to combine both parts  for our VCM algorithm (photon mapping and 
            bidirectional path tracing) proved to be a challenge that demonstrated how much time it took to render images, especially when trying to render different 
            types of media and improve the overall path tracing technique. As mentioned earlier too, there was also difficulty in trying to get the implementation 
            together, as we had to figure out first to get a working version of the entirety of project 3 (both parts). Throughout the entire process of coding up the 
            implementation, we should’ve placed greater emphasis on debugging and also keeping track of images before and after our implementation, to check for frame 
            of reference if there were noticeable differences made by our implementation (which we did do, but would’ve helped if we had started a little earlier with this). 
            Overall though, we gained a greater understanding of not only the VCM algorithm, but also the techniques and algorithms that are behind rendering more complex 
            and unique media and their ability to do so. 
          </p>

          <!-- Results -->
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p> 
            Below are our results with photon mapping. We show initially what the image looked like when rendering without photon mapping, some images that were produced throughout the implemntation and 
            debugging process, and our final render with a completed photon mapping.
